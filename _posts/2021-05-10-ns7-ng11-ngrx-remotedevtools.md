title: "NS7 / NG11 - Send NGRX actions/state to Redux Remote Devtool Server"
tags: ["nativescript", "ngrx"]

I was very excited recently to read a post from [@edusperoni](https://github.com/edusperoni/ngrx-ns) about how to get NGRX state and actions send to a Redux devtools server. 
I would love to see code converted into a proper NS plugin. I would do it, but my plugin dev skills are weak. I would be glad to help maintain it for a year or two if someone creates the plugin and publishes it. 

I created a demo repo to show how it works with NS7. Will get it work with NS8 when NS8 has NG12 support.  See the repo's [README.md](https://github.com/linuxsimba/ns-ngrx-remotedevtools/blob/master/README.md) for more details
