title: "First AngularJS Experiment - Country Database"
tags: ['javascript', 'angular']
---

This is my first exploration into the wonderful world of angularJS. A very
simple country database. It uses the [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu/)  API and [hjnilsson/country-flags](https://github.com/hjnilsson/country-flags) github list of SVG rendered country flags.

What did I learn from doing this?

* Using [Google Material Design
  AutoCompleter](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/autocomplete)
* Bootstrap Grid Layout
* AngularJS MVC.

Type in the name of a country and it prints out basic information about the country. It uses [ngStorage](https://github.com/gsklee/ngStorage) to remember what country you typed in last after a browser reload.
