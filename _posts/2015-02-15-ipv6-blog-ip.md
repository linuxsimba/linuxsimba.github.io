title: Getting blog host name to use an IPv6 address

> Note: Dec 2016 - Had to move the site to a provide who doesn't provide IPv6.
Hopefully the provider will use IPv6 soon.

I have to admit, I'm not a DNS expert. I wish I was.
I plan to setup an IPv6 network in my house soon.
So, to get my feet wet, I setup my blog site with an IPv6 address.

* First, I got an IPv6 address for my blog server. This was not hard.
The Host Provider had easy to follow instructions.

* Next, I went to my DNS provider's website,
and added a **[AAAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URCcDM7eqDI)**
record to my DNS zone file. Below is a snapshot of that information.

> I discuss how I verified IPv6 verification in a [later post]({% post_url 2015-02-16-checking-ipv6-status %})
