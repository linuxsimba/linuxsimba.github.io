Finally getting around to working on the [proposed blueprint for the openstack
ansible
deployment](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+spec/deploy-with-vagrant) found on stackforge.

Below is the proposed topology.

I decided to settle on learning Openstack using the rackspace private cloud
deployment because they use the LinuxBridge agent by default. Really struggle a
lot with OpenVswitch. So learning core Openstack concepts, especially on the
networking side using the LinuxBridge agent has saved me a lot of time.


Let us see how things go. This is should be fun!
