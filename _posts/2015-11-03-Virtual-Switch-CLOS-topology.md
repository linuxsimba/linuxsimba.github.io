title: Virtual Switch CLOS Topology using Vagrant Libvirt
tags: ['vagrant', 'cumulus']
---

I was introduced to [CLOS
architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network) when I joined Cumulus Networks.
Its cool. Definitely beats the old [three layer
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_internetworking_model) of configuring a
Core/Distribution/Access Layer.


I have an [environment, currently all Cumulus virtual
switches](https://github.com/skamithi/vagrant-cw-libvirt), that allows me to play with the CLOS topology.

I plan to expand this in the future , probably rename the project and add
Juniper and Arista VMs.
